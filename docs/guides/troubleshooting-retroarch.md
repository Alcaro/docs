# Troubleshooting RetroArch

When problems arise with RetroArch, it is helpful for the developers and other volunteers to have certain standard information in order to find a solution. When requesting help with a RetroArch issue, please try to include:

1. A description of the problem: What did you expect to happen, and what happened instead?
2. The version of RetroArch you are using
3. The hardware and operating system that you are using
4. If the problem occurs while using a core: What is the the core name, its version, and the name of the game or media you were playing?
5. RetroArch log files recorded when the problem occurs

## Creating Log files in Linux

### RetroArch log in Linux
Start the retroarch service in 'verbose' mode with this command: `retroarch --menu --verbose >> RA-log.txt 2>&1`. The file RA-log.txt is now stored in the home directory.

### Graphic card logs

`lspci -nnk | grep -A 3 VGA` will give information about your graphic card.

### Audio device logs

`aplay -L` enumerates audio devices which have been detected by Lakka.

### Input device logs

`lsusb` lists all devices attached via USB

`dmesg` displays all messages from the kernel ring buffer which typically is holding the messages generated by Lakka's Linux kernel from the boot process. The dmesg log lists each hardware device that the kernel detected along with information on how the device was configured by the system.

## Creating Log files in Windows

1. Open a console window with the `cmd` command. 
2. Navigate to the RetroArch folder
3. Launch RetroArch with this commandline: `retroarch_debug --menu --verbose > RA-log.txt`
