# Installing and Updating RetroArch

Download a stable release [here](https://buildbot.libretro.com/stable) or a current nightly [here](https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/windows/).
There are several files you can download in these folders. For a new installation you want **RetroArch.7z** or the latest setup package (**RetroArch-20XX-XX-XX-setup.exe**).

Both options are identical, the only difference is that one is a self extracting installer, and the other one an archive you have to extract manually. Both are portable installation which means the RetroArch setup is:
- It's self-contained
- It doesn't need users to guess random locations for configurations files
- It's easy to update by just replacing files

If you pick the archive package, extract it in a folder that doesn't require administrator permissions such as *C:\Users\yourusername\RetroArch*. Don't extract it to *Program Files* or your Windows folder. You can update the installation by downloading the latest **20XX-XX-XX-RetroArch.7z** package and overwriting the executable.

If you pick the installer package we recommend to use the default location, follow the installation steps and you should be good to go. You can update the installer version by downloading the latest version and re-running the installer.

!!! Warning
    If you were running a stable release prior to 1.4.0. you will need to update the system libraries. You can do so by downloading the full **RetroArch.7z** package or **redist.7z** from the download locations.
