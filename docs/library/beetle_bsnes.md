## Background

Standalone port of Mednafen bSNES to libretro, itself a old fork of bsnes 0.59.

### Why use this core?

This core exists as a side effect of porting/forking mednafen for its other cores in the past. There's no reason to use this core now that there's other more compatible and faster SNES cores.

### How to get and install the Beetle bsnes core:

- Start up RetroArch. Inside the main menu, go to 'Online Updater'.
