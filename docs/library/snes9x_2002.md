# SNES / Super Famicom (Snes9x 2002)

## Background

Port of SNES9x 1.39 for libretro (was previously called PocketSNES). Heavily optimized for ARM. 

This core is part of a group of Snes9x cores that are snapshots from the year their code is based on.

### Why use this core?

* Provides more favorable performance thresholds at the cost of accuracy. **DO NOT use this core unless you have underpowered hardware and the mainline Snes9x core and the bsnes/higan/bsnes-mercury cores aren't fast enough**
