## All cores

- Fully document every libretro core https://github.com/libretro/libretro-super/tree/master/dist/info
- Should core docs also document every BIOS variant? End-users may ask which BIOS revision lets them see a specific screen. (something similar to this http://www.smspower.org/Development/BIOSes)
- All core docs need update-to-date controller diagrams. (like this https://github.com/libretro/docs/blob/master/docs/library/images/Controllers/4do_retropad.png)
- Update all the core docs whenever the Core Template doc has been updated.
